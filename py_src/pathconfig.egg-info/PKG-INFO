Description: # pathconfig
        
        pathconfig is a small library that aims to make it easy to make your
        application configurable and find its data easily.
        
        it features the following central functions/classes:
        
         * *pathconfig.load_configuration* creates an AppContext object that allows
           to retrieve configuration variables (`get_config_var`)
         * *pathconfig.Factory* is a class for objects that have parts that can be
           loaded on-demand. If `obj` is your object, and it has a `load_banana`
           method, then `obj.get('banana')` will either returned the cached banana
           or invoke its `load_banana`  method to retrieve one.
         * *pathconfig.load_plugin* provides a friendly wrapper around setuptools'
           `entry_points` mechanism.
        
        # Install
        The most convenient way is to install pathconfig via pip or easy_install:
        
        `pip install pathconfig`
